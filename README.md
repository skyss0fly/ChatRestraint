# ChatRestraint

## The Sequel to ChatHijacker:

### What is different about this plugin to ChatHijacker?
> To put it simply, chathijacker stopped people from saying what they want to say in chat **UNLESS** they were whitelisted with a bypass permission
> whereas this version, **ANYONE** can talk except the people put on the list in the server configuration and staff can toggle it to be on or not! 
### The Commands and Permissions:
> TO be able to Toggle the Restraint System, simply type /chatrestraint in the chat.
> If you have the permission: `chatrestraint.use` then you my friend can troll players who are on a list and restrict their chat to No Messages


### GREAT ISN'T IT!?
> sure is, Now what are you still doing reading this README, hurry up and give it a try!
